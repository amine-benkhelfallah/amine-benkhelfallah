😎 About me
------
Passionate about IT, I learned many development skills on my own with [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) .
and also with lots of tutorials on the network. In September 2022, I joined the digital school "La plateform" based in Marseille, to officially reorient myself towards
Web and mobile developer features, to strengthen and complete my skills, in order to become fullstack.


🔎 Currently
------

 I am looking for a work-study contract for the period from March to August 2023 which will help me to continue my studies and to acquire professional
experience during my training.
